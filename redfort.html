The <i><b>Red Fort</b></i> Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital
 of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing 
walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by 
Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private 
apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, 
known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to
 represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought 
to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes,
 but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting
 a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning and
 architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and 
gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.

The planning and design of the Red Fort represents a culmination of architectural development
 initiated in 1526 AD by the first Mughal Emperor and brought to a splendid refinement by Shah 
Jahan with a fusion of traditions: Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu. The innovative planning
 arrangements and architectural style of building components as well as garden design developed 
in the Red Fort strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and 
further afield. The Red Fort has been the setting for events which have had a critical impact
 on its geo-cultural region.</pre></p>
